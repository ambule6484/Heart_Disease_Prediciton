# Heart_Disease_Prediciton
Developed a machine learning application to analyses health parameters and predict heart disease risk.
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis and timely intervention can significantly reduce mortality rates. This project aims to build a machine learning-based system that can predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on various health parameters.

The system uses historical patient data and applies supervised learning techniques to identify patterns and make predictions. By leveraging Python and machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes attributes like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more to provide accurate and efficient predictions.
